CSS Overview:

1. CSS Syntax:
   - The basic structure of CSS is: selector { property: value; }
   - Example:
       p {
           color: blue;
           font-size: 16px;
       }
   - The selector targets HTML elements, and the property-value pair defines their style.

2. CSS Selectors:
   CSS selectors allow you to target specific elements to apply styles. They can be divided into five categories:
   a) Simple Selectors: select elements based on name, id, or class.
      Example: div, #header, .menu
   b) Combinator Selectors: select elements based on a specific relationship.
      Example: div > p, ul li
   c) Pseudo-class Selectors: select elements based on a certain state.
      Example: a:hover, input:focus
   d) Pseudo-element Selectors: select and style a part of an element.
      Example: p::first-letter, span::after
   e) Attribute Selectors: select elements based on an attribute or attribute value.
      Example: input[type="text"], a[target="_blank"]

3. How to Add CSS:
   - Inline CSS: directly in the HTML element using the style attribute.
   - Internal CSS: inside a <style> tag in the HTML <head>.
   - External CSS: in a separate .css file linked to HTML using <link>.

4. Common CSS Errors:
   - Missing semicolons at the end of property declarations.
   - Invalid property names or typos.
   - Invalid values that the property does not accept.
   - Unclosed braces { } or extra colons/semicolons.
   - Conflicting or overriding styles due to selector specificity issues.
   - Forgetting units for properties that require them (e.g., width: 100; should be 100px).
   - Incorrect nesting in CSS (especially in preprocessors like SCSS).
   - Using browser-specific properties without proper prefixes.
   - Misspelling selector names or forgetting a period (.) or hash (#) for classes/IDs.
   - Overusing !important which can make debugging harder.

5. Tips to Avoid CSS Errors:
   - Use a code editor with syntax highlighting to easily spot mistakes.
   - Validate your CSS using a linter or online validator.
   - Write CSS in small sections and test frequently to catch errors early.
   - Comment your CSS sections to stay organized and avoid confusion.
   - Keep consistent formatting and indentation.
   - Test your styles in multiple browsers to catch compatibility issues.
